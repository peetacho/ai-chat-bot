# ai-chat-bot

> ðŸ¤– A Web chat bot platform where users can interact with an AI model created by OpenAI. Created for Shopify's front end developer intern challenge (Fall 2022).

This app is made using React, chakra ui, OpenAI API, and hosted on Firebase. For this challenge, I focused on a minimalistic and clean design while
delivering the promised features of the web app and stellar quality in an efficient manner. This is the link to the site: https://ai-chat-bot-69.firebaseapp.com/
